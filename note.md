/\* Requirements

1. You should only use vanilla javascript and html and css to write the confirmation dialog component without using any library.

2. The confirmation dialog component should be reusable. In other words, you should be able to put multiple buttons on the main page and when you click them you can show the confirmation dialog with different messages. There shouldn’t be any conflicts between your component instances.

3. As a component, the confirmation dialog should be able to accept a message as a parameter from the consumer to display in the modal. It also should return the result (e.g. confirmed or not) to the consumer after the user clicks the buttons.

4. As a consumer, the main page should be able to get the result of the component and do whatever actions accordingly (in this case is to display the according message on the page, but in the real world it can be anything like delete a record, update data etc.)

5. The component and the consumer should be loosely coupled. For example, don’t hard code the logic in the confirmation dialog component to change the text of the main page.

6. When the confirmation dialog shows, it should cover the entire main page. All other elements on the main page shouldn’t be clickable when the dialog displays.

7. Create a git repo in either Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket etc. Commit & push as you would for normally, we expect to see at least a few separate commits. Please share the url in the submission page

8. Please use Loom to record a short, 2 minutes high-level walkthrough for your solution
   Notes
   We all use frameworks regularly, but it’s also important to know what functionality a framework provides versus what javascript language provides.

This challenge does not require a perfect solution or a perfectly built component. We’re looking to see how you approach a problem with limited time.

You can assume that the application & component will be used in the latest Chrome so you can write your code in ES6 without setting up babel or anything like that.
Bonus point
Make the main page and the component look nice by adding your own css of styles and animations. \*/
